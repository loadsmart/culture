# Loadsmart Engineering Culture

ðŸ‘‹ Hello from Loadsmart

This repository describes how Loadsmart Engineering functions. It is a collection of files outlining the tech and non-tech aspects of the day-to-day of an engineer at the company. This is a live project and it will be updated whenever we feel there's a need to change it to better reflect our reality.

If you are a new engineer at the company, welcome! We are happy to have you here with us!

If you are not, but still want to know more about how we do things here, feel free to explore the contents of this repository.

For a more concise and visual version of this repository, you can also check [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12S0OM95M1eLpmkLJmXf05TyTpNvfCU_qiYTNs4rjan8/).

## About us

Loadsmart aims to move more with less. We combine great people and innovative technology to more efficiently move freight throughout North America. Our focus is on designing and building the best tools for our team and our customers, using machine learning models to connect freight with trucks. We automate with algorithms and scale with integrations to better match supply and demand. In doing this we reduce wasted fuel and lost time, cutting out empty miles for motor carriers and providing cost savings and instant booking for shippers.
