# Freedom with responsibility environment

Working hours can be very flexible if previously agreed with your leader. All it takes is to align expectations from both sides. From the leader point of view, sometimes it is needed to have the team together for certain [agile ceremonies](../product-development), for example. For the contributor point of view, sometimes there are personal or family events that require them to be out for a period of the time. And that's OK. Whenever something that could potentially affect another one's expectations, just make sure you communicate and re-set them.

In the end, hours of work won't be tracked in any way but it's expected that we are continuously delivering value. Of course unexpected circumstances may happen like external/personal factors, or lack of knowledge in a give technology or code base, and so on. And that's also totally fine but feel free to voice that. Transparency is key ðŸ”‘.
