# Technical Excellence

Great people like to work with great people. A little clich√©, yeah. But it holds to be true.

As we grow as a company, the challenges around us also grow. Whether that's a technical challenge (more complex architectures, code migration, etc) or people challenge (better org design, new and different types of needs, etc.), increasingly difficult problems will bump onto us. And that's why the need of keep raising the bar is important.

Internally, raising the bar means exercising our [curiosity](./curiosity.md) skills in our day to day work. Keep learning. Keep growing. And make people around you learn and grow the same way.

Externally, raising the bar means hiring people that will increase the overall quality of the team. That may be because of their experience with a specific technology or because their soft skills are lacking in the rest of the team. Whatever that is, not long after that person joins the team, the group feels the difference in growth. Never be afraid of hiring people that are better than you.
