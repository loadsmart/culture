# Positive attitude

Well, humans often rant 🙂
It may happen when you're looking at that legacy code, when you disagree with a process, or anytime you just feel like you need to vent a bit.

Whenever you see yourself in this type of situation, try to think on how that rant can be turned into real action. Some examples would be:

### "Can I refactor this hard-to-maintain code?"
- ❌ "Yes, but that's not my responsibility."
- ❌ "No." And that's it.
- ✅ "Yes! Let me do this."
- ✅ "No, but let me create a tech debt ticket."
- ✅ "No, but I will get other people's opinion to know if they see it as problem too."

### "Maybe the way this is designed it won't scale."
- ❌ "Whatever, let it break."
- ✅ "Let me discuss this with someone. Maybe there's something I'm not seeing."
- ✅ "Maybe we should think about proposing something over an RFC."

### "This onboarding presentation is really boring"
- ❌ (not paying attention) -> Opens YouTube -> Searches for "cute kittens"
- ✅ Have a list of things that you think it could have been better
- ✅ "Hey, thank you for the presentation. I may have a few points that could make this even better."
