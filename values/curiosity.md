# Curiosity

Curiosity is also one of the company's 5 values. We decided to also bring it to Engineering's as it may have different flavors of it.

## Ask the why a.k.a. #clarity

Never take anything for granted. Processes, tech, or product decisions. If you don't understand _why_ something is done that way, feel free to ask. Asking for clarity makes sure people understand context behind decisions and opens opportunities to revisit those decisions in case they don't make sense anymore. 

üìù If fact, the way [meetings](../meetings) are expected to be created are an example of that. 

## Eagerness to grow

### Development Plan

Everyone with more than 3 months in the company should have a development plan on [Reflektive](https://www.reflektive.com/app). It's the tool we use to track the progress of your goals and the one you will look back after a few months to see how much you grew.

When defining goals, try to use the [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) criteria:

- **S** for Specific
- **M** for Measurable
- **A** for Achievable
- **R** for Relevant
- **T** for Time-bound

An example of a SMART goal would be:

> Talk about event-based systems at PyCon 2021 to improve my public speaking skills.

... instead of "Improve communication skills" (which is vague).

Also, don't forget to include non-technical items too. They are usually as important - if not more important - than technical ones.

üìù Your leader will support you with the development plan, but it is your responsibility to decide on the goals and work on them.

### Training

Training is also part of a continuous learning environment. If needed, the company may provide budget for team members that are willing to get better at something. Whether that is an online course, a book, a ticket for a conference or any other sort of content that would help.

As mentioned in the [section above](#development-plan), requests for training budget must be aligned with one's development plan. It should be something that both individual and their direct leader agree on.

After agreeing on the training method with your leader, ask them to bring that to your squad group's leader (this may be a Director or a Manager) and, if approved, they will get the budget from HR.
