## Development Plan

Everyone with more than 3 months in the company should have a development plan on [Reflektive](https://www.reflektive.com/app).
Use SMART goals. Example:
“Talk in a nation wide conference in Q2” instead of “Improving communication skills”.
Do not forget to add non technical items as well. They are usually as important, if not more important, than technical ones.
Your leader will support you with the development plan, but it is your responsibility to define it and work on it.
Talk about it in your 1-1s regularly.

## Training

If needed, Loadsmart will provide budget for training. It always come with a co-participation.
Rules:
People should pay by themselves about 10% to 50% of the costs (the more expensive the cost is, the lower is the participation rate).
The training needs to be aligned with your development plan on Reflektive.
Please use this budget wisely and balance between training time and working time.
If you want to use it, the process is:
Talk to your direct leader.
If it is approved by her/him, the direct leader will talk to HR.
If we still have the budget and it is approved by HR, they will let you know what is the co-participation rate and how to make it happen.
