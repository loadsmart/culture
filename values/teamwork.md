# Teamwork

Strive to always keep a good and positive work environment. We are all humans (are we? ðŸ¤–) and we have to frequently interact with each other in a daily basis. It's not always about coding. Clear and friendly communication is key.

And although we may be focused on delivering results for the teams we are in, it is equally important to collaborate with others and improve our Engineering capabilities. Systems eventually need to talk to each other the same way we do. Those are the moments that teams will get together to discuss solutions. Whenever in this type of situation, instead of thinking "what would be the best outcome for me" think about "what is the best outcome for Loadsmart's Engineering team".

## A note on Pull Requests

Reviewing Pull Requests is part of our daily work as engineers and it's one of the moments that teamwork comes into play.

The main goal of a Pull Request review is to increase overall quality. Having and extra pair of eyes taking a look at a proposed solution gives everybody the chance of building a discussion that will end up in the best possible solution for the moment. Having said that, it's important to state that whenever discussing over a Pull Request, whether as a reviewer or as the author itself, consider asking yourself 3 questions when writing a comment:
1. Is it true?
2. Is it necessary?
3. It it kind?

Being direct and being kind are not opposite things. They can - and should - live together to foster an environment where engineers from any level feel safe to talk their minds and to collaborate with each other.
