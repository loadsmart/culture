## Build vs Buy
Before building something from scratch, make sure there's no 3rd party tool to solve our problem.

On using 3rd party tools or building it ourselves:
- If it is core, prefer building it inside so that we can have more flexibility
- If it is not core, prefer using 3rd party tools
- Also, prefer 3rd party managed services when possible instead of libraries because the operational cost is lower

## Open source

- Be careful with GPL projects and other copyleft licenses - _avoid them_
Avoid branching open source projects because we create another thing to maintain.
- Feel free to contribute back to open source projects! This is a practice that is highly encouraged
- If you think we should make any of our current private projects open, let's discuss that with Loadsmart's engineering leadership
- Do not open source any internal code without communicating to Loadsmart leadership first - _there are some implications that they need to be aware upfront_
- When making a project publicly available, prefer either MIT or Apache v2 as their license. And CC-4.0 for creative content.
- Also make sure your project has clear contribution guidelines and that it is ready to start receiving Pull Requests
