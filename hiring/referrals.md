# Referring a candidate

As a Loadsmart employee, you can refer candidates to us. If you have worked with someone that you think would be a great fit for the company, we would love to hear more. 

At the Loadsmart Engineering team, we believe that great engineers like to work together with great engineers. So we will be definitely taking your opinion into account.

To refer someone, make sure you have access to [Lever](https://hire.lever.co) by signing in using your Loadsmart's Google account and then go to https://hire.lever.co/referrals/new to add your referral. The more context you provide, the easier it will be for hiring managers to review the candidate's profile. 

Referrals are priority in our hiring queue. However, it's important to mention that every candidate goes through the same and all [interviewing steps](./interviewing.md), regardless of their background.

üìù Note: Our referral program is only for internal employees at the moment. We might have external referral programs (non-employees referring candidates) in the future but there's nothing planned on that yet.
