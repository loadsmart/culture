# Platform Operations

- Help engineers to be more productive, and build reliable and secure systems
- Build and maintain an internal application platform that is easy to use and
cost-efficient
- Ensure engineers have great visibility on their operations so they
can spend less time on performance improvement and incident response
- Collaborate with every other engineering squad on architecture design
