# Data Science

### Roles and Responsibilities

- A Machine Learning Engineer and a Backend Engineer require different sets of specialized knowledge. We expect people to choose one main path in which they want to evolve, be responsible for, and thus be evaluated on it. Nevertheless, all are welcome to cross-learn and cross-contribute as long as your main responsibilities are fulfilled. 
- We can work with a diverse stack, and Squads are free to explore new technologies, as long as prior to adoption it should be negotiated with all teammates impacted (specially in other Teams).
- The Data Science Team is free to explore data sources and integrate to models under exploration/development. Prior to go to production though, the Data Engineering and Data Enablement teams need to be consulted about the incorporation of new data sources, in the same way Platform needs to be consulted prior to the usage of new cloud infra-structure services.
