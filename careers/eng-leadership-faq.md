# Engineering Leadership FAQ

### Do Tech Leads have direct reports?
Tech Leads may have direct reports if agreed with their Engineering Manager. Cases when a Tech Lead would want to have direct reports:
1. When they want to increase their communication and leadership skills
2. When being an Engineering Manager is part of their career goals
3. When they want to increase their impact on the team 

In case Tech Lead has direct reports, they should also be the ones doing 1:1 meetings with their reports.

### Is Tech Lead a role or a formal position on the career path?
From now on (June '21), Tech Lead is a role. It is a set of responsibilities that people take in order to increase their level of impact.

### By being a Tech Lead, would I get a salary raise? What about additional stock options?
No. Because Tech Lead is a role (in which ICs will or not be in) and not a full time position. However, by having the experience of being a Tech Lead, people will have the chance of working on things with a broader impact, leading them to experiences that will later be valuable for growth in both technical and management paths.

### Who's responsible for the IC's career growth?
Engineering Managers.

### In terms of scope, where Tech Leads should be looking at? And Engineering Managers?
TL: Sprints, EM: Roadmap and Backlog

### Should the Tech Lead be the most senior individual in the team?
Not necessarily. As the tech lead is a role that any engineer (Senior I+) can play, other engineers in the team may have a higher position.

### Who's responsible for guaranteeing projects are on-time?
Every project has to have a Project Lead. This individual is the responsible for it. Tech Leads may lead Projects too.

### Who's responsible for deciding what is moved from the backlog to the sprint?
Product Managers and Engineering Managers. One understands the problems our customers have while the other, the feasibility. 

### Who's responsible for deciding what is added to the overall teams' backlog?
Product Managers and Engineering Managers. See above.

### Who's responsible for interfacing with other squads?
For technical matters, Tech Leads. For anything else, Engineering Managers. Alignment is expected between peers. TL-TL, EM-EM.

### Who's responsible for leading the agile ceremonies?
Engineering Managers do. But Project Leaders should own the parts of what touches their projects.

### Who's responsible for the quality of the code delivered by the team?
Every engineer in the team is responsible. But ultimately, the Tech Lead is accountable.

### Do Tech Leads code?
They sure do. However, TLs may collect other responsibilities (like 1:1s, cross-squad meetings, etc) that won't let them have full focus on coding. As a rule of thumb, TLs only work on tickets that won't impact the delivery of the sprint and that won't block anybody else on the team. That means:  CIs, tech debts or any non-critical bugs. In general, Tech Leads' time for coding varies from 30% to 70% of their time.

### Do Engineering Managers code?
It is not expected. However, if availability permits, EMs can also work on small CIs, tech debts and non-critical bugs. Even more than TLs, EMs **cannot** be a delivery blocker. In general, Engineering Managers' time for coding varies from 0% to 30% of their time.

### Who can be a Tech Lead?
Any engineer with technical experience equivalent of Senior I willing to take on more responsibilities.

### Who can be an Engineering Manager?
Any Tech Lead with direct reports and with more than 1 year in the role that has decided to continue progressing on the management track is eligible to be an Engineering Manager.

### How many direct reports should an engineering manager have?
6 to 8

### How many direct reports should a Tech Lead with reporting structure have?
Not more than 4.

### If tech lead has direct reports and decide to not be a tech lead anymore, how do restructure these reports?
In this case, Engineering Manager in line will take over the direct reports. However, it is expected this restructure to happen gradually - it helps ICs and Manager to adapt to the new scenario easier.
