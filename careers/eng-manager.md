# Engineering Manager

To think: distributed ownership. [see](https://bradfordcross.com/scaling-engineering-teams-with-distributed-ownership/):


>As the team scales through, it’s important that someone is responsible for organizing the team, process, and ensuring people are happy, productive, and growing, and someone else is responsible for the technical direction and systems of responsibility like code reviews, deploys, and so on.

>Code reviews are similar to design reviews. Everyone has their own personal opinions, so we want to focus the code review on common guidelines rather than idiosyncratic troll comments and flame wars. Tech leads own facilitating among the team to generate a proper style guide that is the prevailing right way to do things. Make sure style guide and reviews include not just design but over-engineering, testing, non-functional, and production infra considerations.

>Both future tech leads and engineering managers show signs of wanting broader impact by shaping the work for people on the team rather than just doing their own work. Those headed for a tech lead path will want to impact the technical direction, build process, code reviews, deploy infrastructure, and so on. Those headed for the management path will tend to take on sub-team lead roles, taking on some of the engineering manager responsibilities for smaller teams such as owning the planning process, and usually starting to take on 1:1s for one or two direct reports. 

>In what I consider to be a more modern and decentralized approach, Engineering Managers work with engineers, who take ownership of chunks of work, decompose them into tasks, estimate, and get the team and manager to review async or in a planning meeting. Everything is tied to the team KPIs, which are tied to the company KPIs, but we don’t need any fancy formats like user stories, etc. Engineers are even more empowered to think about customers, product, and business value in this model — they are looking at how they can impact team KPIs, and empowered to push managers for the work they think is most impactful on the KPIs. The tech lead owns the technical queue — tech debt, testing issues, infrastructure, etc.

## Hiring

- Write master docs for open positions in your team
- Partner with recruiters during the process, being available and optimizing time-to-hire
- Read resumés and provide feedback on them to recruiters, so that they better understand what you are looking for
- Make sure engineers of your team participate in the technical interviews, involve them in the process, get their buy-in
- Lead the Cultural Fit interview
- Work with Engineering Directors and/or VPs on the offer that is going to be made to candidates
- Present onboarding sessions and make your new hire feel welcomed by the team 
- Actively source candidates - it's of manager's best interest bringing the best candidates to the pipeline
- Foresee possible capacity issues, bringing to upper management the need of increasing headcount

## People

- Evaluate training courses, conferences, and any other form of resources to make people grow
- Lead the efforts of helping the team gel better, while also guaranteeing individuals feel like they are part of a safe group
- Provide opportunities for team members to grow in their careers, being available to guide them through your experiences
- Effectively delegate tasks to ICs and/or Tech Leads - that were agreed upon - so that they can grow without being swamped
- Act to resolve conflicts in the team that could not be resolved by the team members themselves
- Rethink team structure if team has grown too big

## Line management (TL+)

- Approve time-off requests
- Review compensation of team members with upper engineering management
- Do weekly or bi-weekly 1:1 meetings in a regular basis with team members
- Constantly provide feedbacks on team members' work, and also do it formally through quarterly check-ins
- Work with HR on a plan when disciplinary and/or performance issues may occur
- Work with ICs on their promotion packages in case you agree with sponsoring them
- [TODO] Conduct exit interviews? (think: maybe we are not that big enough and Gustavo can still do this)

## [TODO] Roadmap (?) Planning

- Constantly keep track of your team's performance, find bottlenecks and act to solve them
- Frequently assess your team's capacity, raising the need for more headcount when capacity is low and to hold on hiring when capacity is too high
- Make joint decisions with Product when features need to be re-prioritized given your team's current capacity
- Be accountable for the OKRs your teams are pursuing and educate team members to also keep their eyes on them
- Pre-align with shareholders what your teams are delivering each quarter, sharing the progress whenever something valuable is delivered

## Process Execution (TL+, PL+)

- Have visibility of what team members are working on now (sprint) and what will they work next (prioritized backlog)
- Be on top of any blockers that are preventing the team from delivering results, and work on unblocking them
- Understand where bugs are coming from, find patterns, and work on the root causes
- Control the growth of tech-debts by constantly and responsibly paying them
- Lead retrospective meetings, create a space where people are feel to speak, distribute and work on the action items

## [TODO] Partnership with Product

- Definition of OKRs
- Roadmap planning
- Review of product specs
- Backlog prioritization

- Does Marketing know what you are building next? What information do they need from you to sell it?
- Do CS know how to support your customers with the new features?
- Feedback from the rest of the business about the product and how the tech team works.
- Are the specs precise, correct, complete, and achievable?
- Features have been requested. Are they technically feasible? What's the general size of it and what quarter can we deliver it by?
