# Project Lead

A Project Lead is an individual contributor of any level that is responsible - from beginning to end - for a given project of their team. They lead the breakdown of user stories during planning sessions, provide status updates during daily meetings or checkpoints, are the internal and external point of contact of the team for any subject related to their project, and are responsible for guaranteeing the deployment and technical success of it. It is also expected that documentation efforts for the given project are also led by the Project Lead.

It is important that teams with multiple projects assign different Project Leads to each one of them, in a rotation fashion. This gives everyone from the team the opportunity to take on small leadership roles. However, remember that finding the right balance between project complexity and engineer's seniority is key to the success of the project and to also not overwhelm individuals.

As you may imagine at this point, Project Lead is also a role. And it can be performed by multiple individuals at the same time. This is a good opportunity for everyone willing to start improving their leadership and communication skills as a software engineer.
