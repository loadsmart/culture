# Engineering Leadership

## Engineering Manager

Engineering Managers are responsible for organizing the team, process, and ensuring people are happy, productive, and growing. However, this is not a pure people management role. Regardless of their technical background (backend, frontend, data science, etc), Engineering Managers should feel comfortable discussing high level architecture of systems (HTTP, API, databases, message brokers, cache, etc). 

## Tech Lead

A Tech Lead is Senior individual contributor who is willing to have a broader impact by shaping the work for people on the team rather than just doing their own work. Their primary goal is to raise the technical bar of their team, by giving them direction and acting as a facilitator. They make sure the team is following Loadsmart's standards for technical quality in all possible related subjects such as automated tests, build and deploy processes, code standards, and so on.

Tech Lead is not a formal position on neither the Technical nor the Management tracks of the Career Path. Instead, it is a set of responsibilities that one has in order to amplify their technical impact to the rest of the team. It is a role.

Because of the fact this role gives individual contributors the opportunity of possibly having their first experience with leadership, many engineers may find themselves still in the process of discovering what type of leadership their career is pointing towards to: pure technical or management. If agreed with Engineering Manager, Tech Leads may have other engineers reporting to them. It is recommended that a Tech Lead does not have more than 4 direct reports, unless being a Manager is their end goal.

Tech Leads also own the technical queue, meaning that they are the ones pulling tech debts, chores, infrastructure tasks, etc. to the current sprint.

## Project Lead

A Project Lead is an individual contributor of any level that is responsible - from beginning to end - for a given project of their team. They lead the breakdown of user stories during planning sessions, provide status updates during daily meetings or checkpoints, are the internal and external point of contact of the team for any subject related to their project, and are responsible for guaranteeing the deployment and technical success of it. It is also expected that documentation efforts for the given project are also led by the Project Lead.

It is important that teams with multiple projects assign different Project Leads to each one of them, in a rotation fashion. This gives everyone from the team the opportunity to take on small leadership roles. However, remember the find the right balance between project complexity and engineer's seniority.
