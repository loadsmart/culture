# Tech Lead

A Tech Lead is a Senior individual contributor who is willing to have a broader impact by shaping the work for the team rather than just doing their job. Their primary goal is to raise the technical bar of their team, by giving them direction and acting as a facilitator. In addition, they make sure the team follows Loadsmart's technical quality standards in all possible related subjects such as automated tests, build and deploy processes, code standards, infrastructure as code, and so on. Tech Leads also own the technical queue, meaning that they are the ones pulling tech debts, chores, infrastructure tasks, etc., to the current sprint.

Tech Lead is not a formal position neither on the Technical nor the Management tracks of the Career Path. Instead, it is a set of responsibilities that one has in order to amplify their impact within the team. It is a role.

Due to the fact this role gives individual contributors the opportunity of possibly having their first experience with leadership, many engineers may find themselves still in the process of discovering what type of leadership their career is pointing towards to: pure technical or management. So, if previously agreed with the Engineering Manager, Tech Leads may have other engineers reporting to them. It is recommended that a Tech Lead does not have more than 4 direct reports, unless being a Manager is their end goal.

Tech Leads represent their squad in Tech Lead meetings and are the default interface of their teams for cross-squad discussions.

For a descriptive - and non-exhaustive - list of tasks performed by a Tech Lead, check the sections below.

## Technical Excellence

- Make sure the process of code reviewing is optimal, providing feedback on what needs to be improved and evaluating whether certain checks need to be manual or automated
- Propose tools or processes that will increase the technical quality of the projects maintained by the team (testing, monitoring, alerting, logging, etc.)
- Guarantee RFCs done by your team are well written, clearly stating what the problem is, as well as the proposed solution, and that it also follows the format Loadsmart expects of a high quality RFC document
- Stay on top of every fire happening on Production, prioritizing putting the fire out first, then working on a plan for a permanent solution. Escalate the problem when needed.
- Together with the Engineering Manager, own your system's SLAs, metrics and monitoring
- Constantly share System Design decisions done by your team with others in the Engineering department so that we spread our technical knowledge
- Understand where bugs are coming from, find patterns, and work on the root causes
- Control the growth of tech debts by constantly and responsibly having the team paying them

## Line Management (if TL has direct reports)

- Approve time-off requests
- Do weekly or bi-weekly 1:1 meetings regularly with team members
- Constantly provide feedback on team members' work, and also do it formally through quarterly check-ins
- Work with HR on a plan when disciplinary and/or performance issues may occur
- Support your Engineering Manager with context data when they are working on a promotion packet of an IC reporting to you
