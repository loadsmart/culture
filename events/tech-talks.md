Everyone is welcomed and encouraged to submit a talk! Whether you have been working as a senior engineer or intern, experienced or 1st-time speaker, we want to hear what you are excited about

Even if we already have a tech talk about a given subject - submit it anyway! We will love to hear your perspective on the subject.
